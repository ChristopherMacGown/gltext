The gltext package offers a set of text rendering utilities for OpenGL
programs. It deals with TrueType and Bitmap (raster) fonts.

Text can be rendered in predefined directions (Left-to-right, right-to-left and
top-to-bottom). This allows for correct display of text for various languages.

This package supports the full set of unicode characters, provided the loaded
font does as well.
